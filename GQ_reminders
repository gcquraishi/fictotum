automate product development given the cast of       
  agents I have created. first, I want to know if      
  there are any other agents it would recommend at     
  this moment; if so, go ahead and create them.        
  second, I want to run this group of agents like      
  they're employees of a real startup and I'm the      
  ceo; instead of me prompting them from scratch,      
  I would like each to develop a roadmap and then      
  prioritize sprints for me to greenlight or           
  tweak. they should ask me as many questions as       
  they would like to make sure they're working on      
  the right problems and they should be aware of       
  what one another are doing.                          
                                                       
⏺ I'll engage the chief-of-staff agent to analyze your 
  current agent roster, recommend any additions, and   
  design an autonomous product development workflow    
  where each agent operates like a startup employee    
  with roadmaps and sprints.

  Three critical gaps were identified and filled:      
                                                       
  1. DevOps Infrastructure Engineer - Handles CI/CD,   
  deployment, Neo4j monitoring, and production         
  debugging                                            
  2. Technical Writer Documentarian - Creates user     
  guides, API docs, and contributor onboarding         
  3. Sprint Coordinator - Orchestrates sprints, manages
   dependencies, and facilitates cross-agent           
  coordination

  - Quarterly Roadmaps: Each of your 12 agents develops
   their own 3-objective roadmap                       
  - Two-Week Sprints: Predictable cycles with clear    
  planning and review ceremonies                       
  - Clarifying Questions Protocol: Agents proactively  
  surface questions before work begins                 
  - Cross-Agent Coordination: Dependency maps, handoff 
  protocols, and workstream visibility                 
  - Lightweight CEO Ceremonies: Only 2-3 hours/month of
   your time required

  Mandatory:                                           
  - Quarterly roadmap greenlight: 30-60 min (4x/year)  
  - Sprint greenlight: 15-30 min (every 2 weeks)       
                                                       
  Total: ~2-3 hours/month                              
                                                       
  48-Hour Bootstrap Plan                               
                                                       
  The system includes a detailed bootstrap timeline to 
  get all 12 agents operating autonomously within 48   
  hours, culminating in your first greenlighted Q1 2026
   roadmap and Sprint 1 plan.                          
                                                       
  Would you like to proceed with the bootstrap? I can  
  have the sprint-coordinator agent begin by creating  
  roadmap templates and distributing them to all       
  agents.

  real-time, high-touch collaboration. Here's the      
  lightweight version:

  step → CEO approves/tweaks → Agent executes → Repeat 
                                                       
  Your time per check-in: 1-2 minutes                  
  Frequency: As often as you want (could be every 15   
  minutes or twice a day)                              
                                                       
  Key Mechanisms

  A living document you can glance at anytime showing: 
  - Currently Active: Who's working on what right now  
  - Ready for Review: What just got completed          
  - Proposed Next Steps: What agents want to do next   
  (awaiting your quick yes/no)                         
  - Blockers: Any stuck work                           
                                                       
  2. The Proposal Pattern                              
                                                       
  Agents propose work in a lightweight format:         
  PROPOSAL: Ingest "Rome" HBO series character network 
  Impact: Adds 30+ characters, connects to Julius      
  Caesar nodes                                         
  Effort: ~45 minutes                                  
  Alternative: Could do documentary series instead     
                                                       
  You respond: "Go" / "Not now" / "Yes but tweak X"    
  (10-30 seconds)                                      
                                                       
  3. Session Handoff Notes                             
                                                       
  When agents complete work, they leave a brief note:  
  Did: Ingested "I, Claudius" with 24 characters       
  Changed: 47 new nodes in Neo4j                       
  Next: Sibling series "Claudius the God" - propose    
  ingesting next?                                      
                                                       
  4. Real-Time Coordination                            
                                                       
  Agents claim resources in the STATUS_BOARD to prevent
   conflicts - self-service, no ceremony needed.       
                                                       
  What Gets Eliminated

  What You Get                                         
                                                       
  - ✅ Always know what's happening (30-second         
  STATUS_BOARD scan)                                   
  - ✅ Agents propose next steps proactively           
  - ✅ Approve work in seconds, not meetings           
  - ✅ Check in as often as you want                   
  - ✅ Feels like working alongside the team in        
  real-time

     This system is designed for a CEO who wants to    
      work alongside their agents in real-time, not    
      manage them asynchronously across days or        
     weeks. Think "co-located startup team" not        
     "remote sprint-based org."

  - What's happening RIGHT NOW                         
  - Currently active work, proposals awaiting your     
  approval, completions ready for review               
  - You check this multiple times per day (30-second   
  scans)

   ~weekly)                                            
  - Brief records of completed routine work

  characters, 47 new nodes"                            
  - Other agents read these to understand what just

  pipeline")                                           
                                                       
  What uses handoff notes instead:                     
  - ❌ Routine ingestions ("Added 'Rome' HBO series")  
  - ❌ Small bug fixes ("Fixed typo in loading state") 
  - ❌ Polish work ("Improved button hover states")    
                                                       
  This keeps CHRONOS_LOG as your project history and   
  learning archive while STATUS_BOARD handles real-time
   operational visibility.                             
                                                       
  I've created both documents:

  - docs/WORKING_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md - Complete agent

❯ tomorrow. how do I call it?                          
                                                       
⏺ Tomorrow, you have several options:                  
                                                       
  Option 1: Check STATUS_BOARD First                   
                                                       
  "Show me the STATUS_BOARD - what's proposed and ready
   for review?"                                        
  Then approve/reject proposals directly.              
                                                       
  Option 2: Ask an Agent to Propose Next Steps         
                                                       
  "research-analyst: what do you recommend working on  
  next?"                                               
  The agent will add a proposal to STATUS_BOARD using  
  the new format.                                      
                                                       
  Option 3: Direct an Agent to Work                    
                                                       
  "data-architect: propose 2-3 high-value tasks for    
  today"                                               
  They'll add proposals, you approve, they execute.    
                                                       
  Option 4: Start a Specific Agent                     
                                                       
  "I'm launching the frontend-polish-specialist to work
   on the timeline UI"                                 
  Or just invoke them directly with the Task tool if   
  you have specific work in mind.                      
                                                       
  Option 5: Get Strategic Guidance                     
                                                       
  "chief-of-staff: review STATUS_BOARD and recommend   
  what I should prioritize today"                      
                                                       
  The key: Every agent now knows about STATUS_BOARD and
   the working session protocol (it's documented). Just
   reference it naturally:                             
  - "Add that to the STATUS_BOARD as a proposal"       
  - "What's in the STATUS_BOARD right now?"            
  - "Go ahead with that proposal from earlier"         
                                                       
  The system is self-service - agents will maintain    
  STATUS_BOARD, you just read and approve.
