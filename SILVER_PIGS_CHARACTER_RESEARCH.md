## 7. SERIES PROPAGATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Complete (The Silver Pigs)
- ✅ Book 1 character web established
- ✅ 11 figures ingested with canonical IDs
- ✅ 12 character interactions documented
- ✅ Series progression tracked

### Phase 2: Upcoming (Books 2-20)
**Propagation Strategy:**
1. For each of Books 2-20 (Shadows in Bronze through Nemesis):
   - Verify which characters from Book 1 appear in the new book
   - Identify new characters introduced in that book
   - Create HistoricalFigure nodes for new characters
   - Create APPEARS_IN relationships
   - Map INTERACTED_WITH relationships for new interactions
   - Update series progression documentation

2. **Efficiency Lever:** Characters already in database (Falco, Helena, Petronius, etc.) can be immediately linked to subsequent books
   - Massive time savings vs. creating from scratch
   - Relationship depth increases with each book
   - Series-wide character network grows exponentially

### Expected Outcomes
- Complete 20-book character network
- 50+ unique characters across series
- 200+ documented character interactions
- Full temporal mapping (AD 70 onwards)
- Cross-series relationship patterns

## 9. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY & VERIFICATION

### Verification Process
1. **Wikidata Cross-Reference:** Verified Q-IDs for all historical figures (Vespasian Q1419, Titus Q1421, Domitian Q1423)
2. **Literary Source Confirmation:** Confirmed character appearances and relationships through multiple sources
3. **Series Continuity:** Validated series progression claims using Goodreads, LibraryThing, and official Davis website
4. **Date/Timeline Validation:** Cross-checked historical dates and character ages against reliable sources

### Canonical Entity Resolution
- **Historical Figures:** Use Wikidata Q-IDs as primary identifier
  - Vespasian: Q1419 (stored as wikidata_id property)
  - Titus: Q1421
  - Domitian: Q1423

- **Fictional Characters:** Use canonical_id based on name + creator
  - marcus_didius_falco (Davis creation, Wikidata Q1469475)
  - helena_justina (Davis creation, no Q-ID available)
  - lucius_petronius_longus (Davis creation)
  - etc.

### Conflict Notes
- No major historiographical conflicts identified in The Silver Pigs
- Historical emperors portrayed accurately in chronological context

## 10. NEXT RESEARCH PRIORITIES

### High Priority
1. **Book 2: Shadows in Bronze** - Verify character set and new additions
2. **Book 3: Venus in Copper** - Continue series progression mapping
3. **Character Age Tracking** - Create timeline of character aging across 20-year series span

### Medium Priority
1. Research "Falco: The Official Companion" (Lindsey Davis guide book)
2. Create character death tracking (which characters exit the series)
3. Map family expansion (Falco's family grows across series)

### Low Priority
1. Cross-reference with any film/TV adaptations (if they exist)
2. Academic analysis of Davis's historical accuracy
3. Create detailed interaction strength metrics

---

## 11. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SERIES CASCADE

### To Ingest Books 2-20 Efficiently:
1. **Use the silver_pigs.py script as template** for subsequent books
2. **Reuse existing character nodes** - MERGE on canonical_id
3. **Add new characters incrementally** - don't duplicate
4. **Track book-specific interactions** - capture unique relationships in each book
5. **Maintain temporal continuity** - respect series timeline (AD 70 onwards)

### Database Optimization:
- Characters appearing in all 20 books will naturally become network hubs
- Historical emperors provide temporal anchors (each rules different period)
- Supporting characters provide relationship bridges between books

**Report Generated:** 2026-01-18
**Analyst:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Series Cascade to Books 2-20
