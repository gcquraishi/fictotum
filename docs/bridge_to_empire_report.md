## Characterization Conflicts

### Young schemer vs Wise patriarch
**Figure:** octavian_augustus
**Type:** Cross-Era Characterization

- **hbo_rome** (Young Octavian): Villainous - Cold, calculating, emotionally distant manipulator
- **cleopatra_1963** (Young Octavian): Villainous - Political schemer, Roddy McDowall's calculating performance
- **i_claudius_novel** (Old Augustus): Complex - Benevolent but blind emperor, manipulated by Livia
- **i_claudius_bbc** (Old Augustus): Complex - Brian Blessed's warm, genial patriarch deceived by wife

**Analysis:** Octavian/Augustus shows the most dramatic characterization shift across media. Works set during his rise (Rome, Cleopatra) portray him as coldly ambitious, while works set during his reign (I, Claudius) show a kindly but naive old man. This reflects both his historical transformation and different narrative needs.

### Ambitious young woman vs Master poisoner
**Figure:** livia_drusilla
**Type:** Cross-Era Characterization

- **hbo_rome** (Young Livia): Complex - Intelligent, ambitious but not yet villainous
- **i_claudius_novel** (Mature Livia): Villainous - Archetypal poisoner, eliminates all rivals systematically
- **i_claudius_bbc** (Mature Livia): Villainous - Siân Phillips's iconic cold-blooded performance

**Analysis:** Livia's portrayal shifts dramatically between works. HBO Rome shows her as newly married and merely ambitious, while I, Claudius (both versions) portrays her as history's greatest poisoner. Robert Graves's interpretation has become the dominant cultural image.

### Tragic romantic hero vs Murderous political thug
**Figure:** marcus_antonius
**Type:** Perspective-Based Conflict

- **hbo_rome** (Full Career): Complex - Passionate, loyal, impulsive but sympathetic protagonist
- **cleopatra_1963** (Egyptian Period): Heroic - Richard Burton's tragic romantic hero
- **cicero_trilogy** (Civil Wars): Villainous - The brutal man who orders Cicero's murder
- **plutarch_lives** (Full Career): Complex - Great general ruined by passion for Cleopatra

**Analysis:** Mark Antony's portrayal depends entirely on the narrative perspective. From Cleopatra's viewpoint, he's a tragic romantic hero. From Cicero's viewpoint, he's the murderer who ordered his execution. This represents genuine historical ambiguity.

### Brilliant hero vs Tyrannical villain
**Figure:** julius_caesar
**Type:** Moral Interpretation

- **masters_of_rome** (Full Career): Heroic - Brilliant, charismatic leader who transforms Rome
- **cleopatra_1963** (Egyptian Period): Heroic - Rex Harrison's charming, witty romantic lead
- **hbo_rome** (Civil War): Complex - Brilliant but ruthless, shown with human flaws
- **ac_origins** (Egyptian Period): Villainous - Allied with the Order of the Ancients conspiracy

**Analysis:** Caesar remains history's most debated figure. Was he a visionary reformer or a tyrant who destroyed the Republic? Modern works tend toward complexity, but AC Origins notably makes him a straightforward villain.

## Anachronisms from Scholarly Review

### HBO Rome
*Sources: Dr. Roel Konijnendijk, Dr. Michael Taylor, Archaeology Magazine*

- Atia portrayed as scheming seductress; historically described as pious, virtuous matron by Tacitus
- Battle formations devolve into 'Hollywood brawl' - lose historical cohesion mid-fight
- Missing key historical figures: Fulvia (Antony's wife), Porcia (Brutus's wife)
- Lack of ethnic diversity - real Roman Empire was far more diverse
- Vorenus and Pullo's lives entirely fabricated beyond names from Caesar's writings

### Assassin's Creed Origins
*Sources: Harvard Egyptologist Peter Der Manuelian, Dr. Chris Naunton*

- Bayek as 'last Medjay' - Medjay ceased to exist centuries before 49 BCE
- Greek-Egyptian ethnic conflict exaggerated; historical record shows integration
- Statues shown unpainted; would have been brightly colored with pigments
- Cyrene shown near Alexandria; actually 500 miles away in modern Libya
- Buildings show no signs of reconstruction despite fragmentary historical evidence
